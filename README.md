# CodeWizard
CodeWizard is a C++ code generator that helps programmers implement common data structures and algorithms quickly and easily.

This program prompts the user to enter a data type for the linked list and then generates the corresponding C++ code for the linked list, with the specified data type. The generated code includes templates for a Node class and a LinkedList class, along with methods to insert nodes into the linked list and print the linked list.

Once the code is generated, it is written to a file named linked_list_[data_type].cpp where [data_type] is the user-specified data type. The generated code can then be used as a starting point for implementing a linked list data structure in C++.
